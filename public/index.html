RPR takes heroes and their abilities from our virtual reality and makes them come alive in our everyday life. The standard approach in H&OD delivers mediocre results. Trainings and workshops are isolated from the system they are supposed to improve. What happens there, stays there and it doesn’t get integrated into the person and transferred into business and private life. Participants don’t assume ownership and their continuous growth is not achieved. It doesn’t stick. Let’s face it. It is boring. No spark. Plain, uninspiring, dreary. Form over substance. And the secret key of leveling it up is hidden in our emotions. Start from there and cognitive processes will follow. </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo"> <h2 class="mb-0"> <button class="btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"> It is not for everybody, right? <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> </button> </h2> </div> <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordionExample"> <div class="card-body"> No, it is not. It’s for l33t only. Well, it is not complicated to play. We will guide you every step of the way. Your success is our goal as your OrgMasters. However, when you play, you will stay in your character the whole time. You will discipline your mind, utilize your creativity, and form designated habits. You will play with your party or fellowship and one spiritless member can jeopardize the whole campaign. In addition, we have designed it to be challenging, demanding, and tough, as human and organizational development is. It is gaming, but it is also training and L&D.

And even if we do it, we rarely condition it to become a habit. In leadership development, “these days, reality is a bummer. Everyone is looking for a way to escape.” Two ‘realities’ limit the person’s growth. The ‘reality’ of the environment in the organization and its culture and the ‘reality’ of what one perceives as achievable and realistic. While conquering the Tower, players shape their own reality and are training through gaming to make it stick. Many levels represented by stores, many areas representing life challenges and learning opportunities, and hundreds of monsters attacking our players and preventing them to become the best they can be. </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header" id="headingFive"> <h2 class="mb-0"> <button class="btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFive" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="col#collapseFive"> Tell us more about E&E <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> </button> </h2> </div> <div id="collapseFive" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFive" data-parent="#accordionExample"> <div class="card-body"> The E&E campaign contains more variations in its quests.

The key difference in the design of the campaign is whether you want to improve your company starting from ‘as is’ in the now or you choose to foresee the future, envision your company in it, and then start connecting dots. In either case, you are building something remarkable. Understanding how to unlock human potential to raise organization optimism, satisfy the need for togetherness and belonging. Become great at seeing the hidden and invisible. Organization happiness and emotional pollution. Create a shared vision, fuel it with trust and commitment and roll a dice. The future belongs to you if you take the risk. </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header" id="headingSix"> <h2 class="mb-0"> <button class="btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSix" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="col#collapseSix"> Tell us more about yourself. <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> </button> </h2> </div> <div id="collapseSix" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSix" data-parent="#accordionExample"> <div class="card-body"> We are probably much crazier than we appear.
