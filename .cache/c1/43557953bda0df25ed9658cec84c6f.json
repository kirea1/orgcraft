RPR takes heroes and their abilities from\n                      our virtual reality and makes them come alive in our\n                      everyday life. The standard approach in H&OD delivers\n                      mediocre results. Trainings and workshops are isolated\n                      from the system they are supposed to improve. What happens\n                      there, stays there and it doesn’t get integrated into the\n                      person and transferred into business and private life.\n                      Participants don’t assume ownership and their continuous\n                      growth is not achieved. It doesn’t stick. Let’s face it.\n                      It is boring. No spark. Plain, uninspiring, dreary. Form\n                      over substance. And the secret key of leveling it up is\n                      hidden in our emotions. Start from there and cognitive\n                      processes will follow.\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card\">\n                  <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                    <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\n                      <button class=\"btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseTwo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwo\">\n                        It is not for everybody, right?\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>\n                      </button>\n                    </h2>\n                  </div>\n                  <div id=\"collapseTwo\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTwo\" data-parent=\"#accordionExample\">\n                    <div class=\"card-body\">\n                      No, it is not.

However,\n                      when you play, you will stay in your character the whole\n                      time. You will discipline your mind, utilize your\n                      creativity, and form designated habits. You will play with\n                      your party or fellowship and one spiritless member can\n                      jeopardize the whole campaign. In addition, we have\n                      designed it to be challenging, demanding, and tough, as\n                      human and organizational development is. It is gaming, but\n                      it is also training and L&D. As one ‘beta tester’ said:\n                      ”How will you envision the future of your company if you\n                      can’t envision the present of your E&E campaign?!”\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card\">\n                  <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                    <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\n                      <button class=\"btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseThree\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseThree\">\n                        What about the lore? <i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>\n                      </button>\n                    </h2>\n                  </div>\n                  <div id=\"collapseThree\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\" data-parent=\"#accordionExample\">\n                    <div class=\"card-body\">\n                      We hold both the lore and the stories sacred as well as\n                      characters arcs. RPR is not a treasure hunt training with\n                      metaphorical masks put on the everyday problems. We don’t\n                      pretend to game. RPR is meant for gamers who appreciate\n                      great stories and world building and people who will\n                      immerse themselves in the quests. No Snokes or plot holes.\n                      Most of the inspiration comes from 500 pages long SF novel\n                      written by <strong>OrgMaster Matej</strong>.

And even if we do it, we rarely condition it to\n                      become a habit. In leadership development, “these days,\n                      reality is a bummer. Everyone is looking for a way to\n                      escape.” Two ‘realities’ limit the person’s growth. The\n                      ‘reality’ of the environment in the organization and its\n                      culture and the ‘reality’ of what one perceives as\n                      achievable and realistic. While conquering the Tower,\n                      players shape their own reality and are training through\n                      gaming to make it stick. Many levels represented by\n                      stores, many areas representing life challenges and\n                      learning opportunities, and hundreds of monsters attacking\n                      our players and preventing them to become the best they\n                      can be.\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"card\">\n                  <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingFive\">\n                    <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\n                      <button class=\"btn btn-link btn-block text-left collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseFive\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"col#collapseFive\">\n                        Tell us more about E&E\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>\n                      </button>\n                    </h2>\n                  </div>\n                  <div id=\"collapseFive\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingFive\" data-parent=\"#accordionExample\">\n                    <div class=\"card-body\">\n                      The E&E campaign contains more variations in its quests.\n                      Although some solutions in OD are widely applicable, the\n                      bespoke quests will enable the party to finish this\n                      campaign. The key difference in the design of the campaign\n                      is whether you want to improve your company starting from\n                      ‘as is’ in the now or you choose to foresee the future,\n                      envision your company in it, and then start connecting\n                      dots. In either case, you are building something\n                      remarkable. Understanding how to unlock human potential to\n                      raise organization optimism, satisfy the need for\n                      togetherness and belonging. Become great at seeing the\n                      hidden and invisible. Organization happiness and emotional\n                      pollution. Create a shared vision, fuel it with trust and\n                      commitment and roll a dice.
